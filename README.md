## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Perfect Pixel](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=es) - Resource that allows me to compare the details of the design i have to the one i desire to get. So i can adjust font size, margin, padding, etc.
- [Mozilla Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) - This article helped me understand shadows a bit more. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
